| description   = Thanos was one of the last sons of [[A'Lars (Earth-616)|A'Lars]], progenitor of the second colony of [[Eternals]] on [[Titan (Moon of Saturn)|Titan]], and [[Sui-San (Earth-616)|Sui-San]], the last survivor of the original settlement of Eternals on Titan. Born with purple, hide-like skin and a massive body due to being born with the [[Deviants (Race)|Deviant]] Syndrome, Thanos was a morose child who became obsessed with the concept of death. Through bionic implementation and long hours of meditation, Thanos augmented his Eternal strengths and powers so that his abilities surpassed those of all other Titanian Eternals.
