| description     = Leaping from the legends of Norse mythology, the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] God of Thunder, '''[[Thor Odinson]]''', is the son of [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] the All-Father and [[Gaea (Earth-616)|Jord]], Elder Goddess and spirit of the [[Earth]]. He frequently stands alongside the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] in the defense of the people of Midgard (Earth), often against the schemes of his adopted brother [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]]. He formerly dwelt in a recreation of [[Asgard]] in [[Oklahoma (State)|Oklahoma]], using the mortal form of [[Donald Blake (Earth-616)|Donald Blake]] to provide a bridge between his people and the mortals surrounding them. However, Loki's subtle trickery and manipulations of [[Balder Odinson (Earth-616)|Balder]], combined with her time-twisting of Asgard's past and that of [[Bor Burison (Earth-616)|Bor]] and Odin's has enabled her to banish Thor from Asgard, stripping him of his titles, throne and legal power, and move his people to [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]'s [[Latveria]], having planned this ever since her rebirth. Thor returned to Asgard, just in time to aid them in a battle against [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn's]] [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]], [[X-Men (Osborn) (Earth-616)|X-Men]], and [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]], killing [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] after he destroyed Asgard. Feeling lonely, Thor has resurrected his brother Loki and father Odin and they continue to battle-on for the survival of Asgard.
